## About
This project's aim is simple: to leverage the existing open-source [platform as a service (PaaS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service),
[flynn](https://github.com/flynn/flynn), and NVIDIA-specific docker tools for
GPU device/library automatic discovery and mounting, [nvidia-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker), to build a PaaS for GPU-accelerated applications.

**tl;dr**: *It's a PaaS for Machine Learning!*
